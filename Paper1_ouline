1.0 Introduction
The Trans-Atlantic slave trade brought the economies of Europe and West Africa into greater contact than ever before. Through the framework of Marxist interpretations of class structure and economic activity, we can see that the Trans-Atlantic slave trade acted as driving force in an economic revolution within Ghana, creating a new Bourgeoisie class that was uninvolved with sustenance agriculture.

The limited economic exchange present before the beginning of the slave trade consisted mainly of textile imports from Europe and gold exports from Ghana. This trade economy was not a significant driver in a Ghanaian society that relied primarily on sustenance agriculture.

This paper will look at the efrfects of the slave trade on the people of Ghana through the frameowk of a marxist vocabulary. I hope to center the narrative on the changes to the economic life of everyday people by analysing the impact of a new and revolutionary economic modality that arrose out of the slave trade.

1.1 Thesis


2.0 Anowa
The play Anowa by Ama Atu Aidoo presents a modern retelling of an archetipycal morality play. The traditional story tells of a disobediant doughter who rejects her parents and marries an attractive stranger, only for him to be revieled as the devil in duisguise. Aidoo adapts this narrative by substituting an abstract devil in duisguise with Kofi, a verry real man who becomes cought up in the slave trade and becomes part of a new economic class in Ghana, the Bourgeoisie. The symbolism of Kofi emerges more fully when put into the context of the traditional folklore. Kofi is an embodiement of the devil. Aidoo's criticism of the slave trade is obvious from the start, but instead of focussing her anger and resenment on the European Slave traders, she chooses a Ghanain man to embody the evil of slavery. This choice is intentional and adds nuance to an otherwise two sided exhange. The evil of slavery is not only in the European creation of the trade, but also in Ghanaian participation.

The slave trade is creating a new Bourgeoisie class of Ghanaian merchants who do not work. One of Anowa's chief compalints is that her and her husband no longer participate in meaningfull farm work. Anowa is realizing that Kofi's place in the economic order is becoming somehting not seen before in Ghana. Kofi creates a new Bourgeoisie class that does not provide self sufficincy for itself. Even kings households were traditionally mainly self sufficent (Hymer, 39). This relation that Anowa has with labor echos Marx's writing on the meaning of labor to humans
